Fuseli painted horrific and macabre scenes, taking his inspiration from  gothic and late mediaeval tales. His paintings were published through mezzotints such as this one, published in 1785: mezzotint is a printmaking technique that is ideal for gloomy and mysterious subjects, especially night-scenes"
